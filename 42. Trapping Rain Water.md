# 42. Trapping Rain Water.md

### Idea: Two Pointers

Use left and right to track the max height that we have encountered. Basically, it could only trap water if there is some height higher than the current height. 

``` python

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        res = 0; 
        leftMax = height[l]
        rightMax = height[r]

        while l < r: 
            if leftMax < rightMax: 
                res += max(0, leftMax - height[l])
                l += 1
                leftMax = max(leftMax, height[l])
            else: 
                res += max(0, rightMax - height[r])
                r -= 1
                rightMax = max(rightMax, height[r])

        return res; 
```
